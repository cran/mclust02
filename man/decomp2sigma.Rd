\title{
  Convert mixture component covariances to matrix form.
}
\description{
  Converts a set of covariances from a parameterization by 
  eigenvalue decomposition to representation as a 3-D array.
}
\usage{
decomp2sigma(d, G, scale, shape, orientation, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{d}{
    The dimension of the data. 
  }
  \item{G}{
    The number of components in the mixture model. 
  }
  \item{scale}{
    Either a \emph{G}-vector giving the scale of the covariance (the
    \emph{d}th root of its determinant) for each component in the
    mixture model, or a single numeric value if the scale is the same
    for each component.  
  }
  \item{shape}{
    Either a \emph{G} by \emph{d} matrix in which the \emph{k}th column
    is the shape of the covariance matrix (normalized to have
    determinant 1) for the \emph{k}th component, or a \emph{d}-vector
    giving a common shape for all components. 
  }
  \item{orientation}{
    Either a \emph{d} by \emph{d} by \emph{G} array whose \code{[,,k]}th
    entry is the orthonomal matrix of eigenvectors of the covariance
    matrix of the \emph{k}th component, or a \emph{d} by \emph{d}
    orthonormal matrix if the mixture components have a common
    orientation. The \code{orientation} component of \code{decomp} can
    be omitted in spherical and diagonal models, for which the principal
    components are parallel to the coordinate axes so that the
    orientation matrix is the identity.  
  }
  \item{\dots}{
    Catch unused arguments from a \code{do.call} call.
  }
}
\value{
  A 3-D array whose \code{[,,k]}th component is the 
  covariance matrix of the \emph{k}th component in an MVN mixture model.
