MCLUST: Copyright 1991-2009 University of Washington.  All rights reserved.

The term MCLUST used here refers to all versions of the software, including
contributed R language (CRAN) packages named mclust, mclust02, and mclust98, 
and the mclust package available in the S archive of StatLib. 

In-house use of MCLUST by commercial and nonprofit organizations, and by academic
users in conjunction with fee-based  products or services such as consulting 
requires payment of an annual license fee and completion of a license agreement 
for MCLUST found at the following URL:
http://depts.washington.edu/ventures/UW_Technology/Express_Licenses/mclust.php
Nonprofit use for internal research may be exempt from license fees under certain
conditions - send inquiries to license@u.washington.edu.

CRAN master (WU Wien) and all of its mirrors are permitted to distribute
MCLUST as an R package. Otherwise distribution of MCLUST or of modifications 
thereof is prohibited except by special license agreement with the University 
of Washington.

For academic users for internal research, the University of Washington and 
the developers of MCLUST, Chris Fraley and Adrian Raftery in the Department of 
Statistics, give permission for you and your Institution to copy, perform, 
display and modify the MCLUST software under the following conditions:  

1. the MCLUST software, including any modifications you may have made to it, 
   remains at your Institution and is not published, distributed, or 
   otherwise transferred or made available in whole or in part, modified or 
   unmodified, to other than Institution employees and/or students under your 
   direct supervision;

2. you retain in MCLUST and any modifications to MCLUST the copyright, 
   trademark, or other notices pertaining to MCLUST as provided by the 
   University of Washington;

3. you provide the MCLUST developers with feedback on the use of the MCLUST 
   software in your research, and you permit the MCLUST developers and 
   University of Washington to use any information you provide in making 
   changes to the MCLUST software; 

4. you acknowledge the right of the University of Washington to prepare and 
   publish modifications to MCLUST that may be substantially similar or 
   functionally equivalent to your modifications and improvements, and if you 
   obtain patent protection for any modification or improvement to MCLUST you 
   agree not to allege or enjoin infringement of your patent by the 
   University of Washington or by any of the University of Washington's 
   licensees obtaining modifications or improvements to MCLUST from the 
   University of Washington; 

5. you acknowledge in your publications contributions to your research 
   involving or based on the MCLUST software by citing the following 
   references (bibtex entries can be found at the bottom of this file);

6. those whose only use of MCLUST is through one of the following packages
   prabclus, fpc, clustvarsel, spotSegmentation, or latentnet must cite the primary 
   references associated with those  packages but need not cite the 
   above references as a condition for software use --- 
   all other provisions of the license apply;

7. any risk associated with using the MCLUST software at your Institution 
   is with you and your Institution. MCLUST is experimental in nature and 
   is made available as a research courtesy "AS IS," without obligation
